This website showcases the TDLEG research projects of undergraduate students at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). TDLEG is the Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant of PI [Dr. Matthias Buehlmaier](http://www.buehlmaier.net/) (HKU) and Co-I [Prof. Dr. Gregor Dorfleitner](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/business-economics-and-management-information-systems/business-dorfleitner/staff/gregor-dorfleitner/index.html) (University of Regensburg).

## Project List

### Clojure Heap

  Contributor: Grace ZHONG Yanting

  As one of the most important data structures in programming, heap or priority queue could be used to force the order of outputs. A Clojure wrapper of ```java.util.PriorityQueue``` would be provided in this project, including basic APIs such as init, add, pop, etc.

### Data Processing Domain-Specific Language in Clojure

  Contributor: Parry CHOI Chong Hing

  Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a computer language, declared syntax or grammar that is specialised to a specific application. In contrast to General-Purpose Language, implemenation of DSL is designed with specific goals in that application domain. The use of macros in Lisp dialects enables developers to rewrite source code at compile time, making implementation of DSL more convenient. As one of the Lisp dialects, Clojure also inheriates such advantage. In addition to macros, the heavy use of core data literals in Clojure also gives an extensive developing opportunity in implementing DSLs.

  In this project, a DSL extension to the existing data processing library, ```tech.ml.dataset```, will be developed. A generic query using core data literal serves as the foundation of the DSL. This enables huge flexibility in defining the syntax, subject to Clojure’s limitation.

### Delta Hedging With Clojure Backtesting Library

  Contributor: Cindy WANG Xizhuo

  Construct a delta hedging strategy using the backtesting library in Clojure. Optimize the calculation of delta based on data science methods. Generate return results and use them for comparison.

### Development of Heap Structure for Data Storage and Output in Clojure

  Contributor: ZHU Jiarui

  Heap is a kind of efficient data storage structure, especially in the representation of priority queues. So it is a good choice for data logging, sorting and output.

  Existing implementations are mostly based on index operations in vectors, rather than the real tree structure. This kind of structure cannot meet the requirements for efficient computing. 

  In this case, we need a maximum/minimum heap implementation scheme that is more in line with the characteristics of the heap.

### Exploring the Signaling Effect of Equity Offering in Venture Capital Investment

  Contributor: LIN Maoran

  This project will explore the impact of firms’ equity offering decisions in venture capital deals with the theory of signaling game. It will assess the signaling effect of equity offer by reviewing the mathematical model proposed in Gibbons (1992) and analyzing the empirical data.

### HKU-TDLEG Website Development

  Contributor: Kevin ZHANG Wenkai

  Developing a website can be hard, but tools make it easier. In this project, a static website development tool based on Clojure, ```Cryogen```, will be used to develop the HKU-TDLEG website. The contributor will explore the features and advantages of Cryogen, and try to develop a professional blog website recording the progress of all contributors' work.
