{:title  "Blog Six - Another Major Version Update"

As all projects are approaching the end, I receive more and more materials, and the website is almost done. Dr. Matthias Buehlmaier and I have come up with a final layout of the website: In addition to deleting the ```content``` page, I also deleted the ```about``` page and ```archive``` page. Instead, I added all projectsâ€™ pages to the navbar.

The ```home``` page now has more information. Besides the link to the project page, viewers now have access to ```Poster```, ```Virtual poster session```, ```Proposal```, ```Summary report```, and ```GitHub repository```.

The layout of each project page is also changed. Now, viewers can see ```Contributor```, ```Description```, ```Blogs```, and ```Details``` on it. Under the ```Blogs``` category, viewers can check detailed project blogs. Under the ```Details``` category, viewers also find the links to ```Poster```, ```Virtual poster session```, ```Proposal```, ```Summary report```, and ```GitHub repository```.

For daily maintenance, I modified several links, deleted the GitHub icon, and changed menu titles to lower case according to layout changes. I uploaded three posts, seven proposals, six reports, six posters, and four presentation videos. I also rewrote some blog names (according to English title capitalization rules) and renamed several RAs (according to their preferred names).

So far, no problem has been encountered. Now, all RAs have their own project pages. When I receive all the materials and upload them onto the website, the website will be finished.
