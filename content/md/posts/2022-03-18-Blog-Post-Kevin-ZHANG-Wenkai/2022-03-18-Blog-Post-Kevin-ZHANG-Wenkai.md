In the past two weeks, I have redesigned the structure of the website: Adding a page for each contributor and recording their posts on it. I also asked every contributor to send me their projects' names and descriptions, and I uploaded them to the website. Now, on the ```home``` page, viewers can find names and descriptions of projects, followed by a link to a catalog (the page for each contributor) of related posts. I think it makes the website clearer and more professional. Once the job is finished, the ```content``` page can be discarded. For the daily maintenance job, I uploaded seven posts to the website, changed some blogs' names, and fixed a minor rendering bug.

So far, no problem has been encountered. Some RAs were busy with their midterm exams and have not sent me their project names and descriptions. Once receiving all the materials, I can delete the ```content``` page.
