I failed to find a way to change the language of the date, so I changed my system language. Now the website is all in English. I also uploaded five posts to the website. As the number of posts increased, I also made some changes to the ```home``` and ```about``` pages: The ```home``` page is now more detailed with some instructions on how to read contributors’ posts and several links to new repositories (that belong to contributors) were added to the ```about``` page. 

The tough job, however, was to modify the appearance of the website. A small change can affect the layout of the entire page. I did it very carefully: I tested the website each time I made a minor change. I made some mistakes, but I could fix the problems without influencing the actual website because I tried the layout locally. In the end, it turned out that I didn’t mess up, and the website looks better and better now.
