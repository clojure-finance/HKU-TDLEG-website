{:title  "Blog four - Daily maintenance"

I have finished most of the tough jobs so now I start to focus on daily maintenance (adding posts and pages) and minor changes (font, color, size, layout, etc). For daily maintenance, I uploaded three posts. I added two links to new repositories. I also added project descriptions to the ```home``` page and viewers now can learn what each project is about. For minor changes, I deleted the ```next``` and ```prev``` buttons on each post (the buttons showed the full names of the next and previous posts, which were very long, and looked not nice). I change the titles from all caps to only caps the first letter, making them easier to read.

So far, no problems have been encountered and all the works go smoothly.
