## Work I have done these days
- Composing the research proposal

  This is the first time for me to write a research proposal. I have included all the contents that I regarded necessary for the audience to know what the 
  research is doing. However, there are still some parts that need more details. 
- Conducting literature review 

  I am reviewing a lot of research that other people have done about hedging strategies. The part that I am most interested in is how they selected data, 
  how they came up with the strategy, and also how they put their ideas in practice. 
- Learning Clojure

  I have gone through the [Clojure by examples](http://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/#about-this-page). However, only simple syntax may be not 
  enough. Therefore, I will explore more sources the learn the language. 
  
## Difficulties I encountered
- Data collection

  I needed historical option data for backtesting. However, in a finance class I attended, I was told that there is actually no free data for option prices.
  I raised this question in our meeting, and thanks to Dr.Gao, I was referred to the [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) website. HKU has subscribed the data, and now I am learning how to make queries to get the data I want. 
- Settle down the strategy

  I should admit that I am still at the exploring stage. I know I have to do delta hedging, but still hesitate about what kind of securities I should use. I can 
  to use call and put options or options with the underlying. However, this may not be a big issue because with all the data and accurate strategy both of them 
  are feasible.   
  
## Heading for the next stage
- Getting more familiar with Clojure

  After surviving the Bloody Nov, I will do more comprehensive study about Clojure. 
- Working out strategies

  I actually kicked off the outline, but it was just a start.
