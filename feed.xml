The syntax design is flexible with the help of macros. We could develop a syntax for our DSL as long as it is recognised by the Clojure language (i.e. following some fundamental rules and syntax imposed by Clojure).Clojure has a heavy use of expressions in the language. Every expression is separated and seen as a separate object to Clojure. It could not phrase or recognise syntax like DT[, col1,col2] - Clojure cannot extract the keywords like col1 and col2 here. In other words, spacing is very important in Clojure, every expression is separated by a space. It is a fundamental syntax of Clojure. This is the biggest limitation imposed by Clojure.</description><author>CHOI Chong Hing</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-ZHONG-Yanting/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-ZHONG-Yanting/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-ZHONG-Yanting/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-ZHONG-Yanting/</link><title>First Blog - Grace Zhong</title><description>After some back and forth, I decided on the pure computer science project – heap in Clojure, as an exploration in data structure while catering for a small technical need in Clojask.After some research and discussion, I found that there are two main methods to approach this problem:</description><author>ZHONG Yanting</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</link><title>Data Science in Finance - Third Blog</title><description>Work I have done these daysApply strategy to real data set.Apply the basic delta-heding strategy to 5 years data (from 2016 to 2020).

With the lower investment confidence, which is denoted by higher q, there are higher probabilities that some equity offers would be rejected (Vrankić &amp; Skoko, 2021). This might lead to a preliminary hypothesis that a higher share ratio in the offer might be correlated with a lower investment confidence and thus, a lower investment success ratio (Vismara, 2016).</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</link><title>Blog Post-CHOI Chong Hing_20220129</title><description>The implementation of the DSL query foundation went well. The biggest problem I have encountered was the group by operation. This is mainly due to the difference in the output results of the generic query and the tech.ml.dataset. The group by function in tech.ml.dataset outputs a map with the column values (or indices) to the corresponding datatable; while our query would be outputting a single datatable, similar to SQL query. The library also does not support multiple column group-by operation.To solve the difference in output, a table join between the first item in group-by datatable and the descriptive table is made. This combines all the aggregated columns and the original columns, forming a table with all columns.</description><author>CHOI Chong Hing</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</link><title>Data Science in Finance - Second Blog</title><description>Work I have done these daysManaging the option datasetThe option dataset downloaded from the WRDS website is different from the CRSP dataset used in the backtesting library.

After conducting research, I have decided to build my decentralized application (dApp) on top of Ethereum as it is one of the largest blockchains and it supports smart contracts. Although bitcoin also supports smart contracts, it was built with the intention of being an alternative to national currencies. Whereas for Ethereum, it was built for the purpose of facilitating programmatic contracts and applications, as according to Investopedia. As such, Ethereum has a stronger and more mature foundation on smart contracts.</description><author>Oscar Jey LEW</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-02-Blog-Post-Twitter-LIN-Maoran/2022-01-02-Blog-Post-Twitter-LIN-Maoran/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-02-Blog-Post-Twitter-LIN-Maoran/2022-01-02-Blog-Post-Twitter-LIN-Maoran/</link><title>The Starting Point of Coding with Clojure</title><description>This is the starting point for me to code an economic model using Clojure.It is my first time to use a Java dialect.

Suppose we have the project with the success rate $p_0$, and failure rate $p_i=1-p_0$. It is the firm deciding at which date $t \ge 0$ it will invest. The rationale of delaying investment is to do experiment and learn about the project, the longer they need to learn, the lower quality the firms have. According to Vrankić and Skoko (2021), this learning process could be following a Poisson process with $\lambda$ as the intensity of observing a low-quality project in firms' experiment if $\lambda \ge 0$. Hence, the higher the $\lambda$ is, the lower type the firm belongs to.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</link><title>Initial Ideas about the Signaling Game Model for Clojuring</title><description>Initial ideas about the signaling game model I wish my Clojure to simulate.Suppose for an investment opportunity with payoff $\pi$, there are two types of firms with different profitability $\lambda_h$ and $\lambda_l$.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-WANG-Xizhuo/</link><title>Data Science in Finance - First Blog</title><description>Work I have done these daysComposing the research proposalThis is the first time for me to write a research proposal.

Without clear pictures about firms’ real quality, investors and financial institutions would need signals to facilitate their financing decisions. It would be assumed by investors that firms with lower quality would choose to delay their investment and operation while high-performance companies would have earlier implementation of their decisions. Hence, as a strategy to fool outsiders, the low-quality firms would have the signal incentive to mimic the investment timeline as high-quality firms to extract bonus in their loans, while the high- type firm would try to distinct their identities by accelerating their investments and operations. We would like to explore how Clojure could help us build a signaling game model to evaluate the effectiveness of this timing strategy. We would then apply this model with empirical panel data collected by a World Banks’ Enterprise level survey on Chinese enterprises to test its validity.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
