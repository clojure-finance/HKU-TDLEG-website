Dr. Matthias Buehlmaier and I have come up with a final layout of the website: In addition to deleting the content page, I also deleted the about page and archive page. Instead, I added all projects’ pages to the navbar.The home page now has more information. Besides the link to the project page, viewers now have access to Poster, Virtual poster session, Proposal, Summary report, and GitHub repository.</description><author>Kevin ZHANG Wenkai</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-18-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-03-18-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-18-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-03-18-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</link><title>Blog Five - A Major Version Update</title><description>In the past two weeks, I have redesigned the structure of the website: Adding a page for each contributor and recording their posts on it. I also asked every contributor to send me their projects' names and descriptions, and I uploaded them to the website. Now, on the home page, viewers can find names and descriptions of projects, followed by a link to a catalog (the page for each contributor) of related posts. I think it makes the website clearer and more professional. Once the job is finished, the content page can be discarded. For the daily maintenance job, I uploaded seven posts to the website, changed some blogs' names, and fixed a minor rendering bug.So far, no problem has been encountered. Some RAs were busy with their midterm exams and have not sent me their project names and descriptions. Once receiving all the materials, I can delete the content page.</description><author>Kevin ZHANG Wenkai</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-14-Blog-Post-ZHU-Jiarui/2022-03-14-Blog-Post-ZHU-Jiarui/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-14-Blog-Post-ZHU-Jiarui/2022-03-14-Blog-Post-ZHU-Jiarui/</link><title>Clojure Methods for OOP Development</title><description>1. defrecordstandard formula: (defrecord name [&amp; fields] &amp; opts+specs)</description><author>ZHU Jiarui</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-12-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-03-12-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-03-12-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-03-12-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</link><title>Sort-by Function Implementation</title><description>With the basic foundation and design implemented, we try to add more query options.

For the syntax design, the third section has been changed to option section, including group-by, sort-by and future options. However, for the query to differentiate different options, keywords for different options are included.

For minor changes, I deleted the next and prev buttons on each post (the buttons showed the full names of the next and previous posts, which were very long, and looked not nice).

The syntax design is flexible with the help of macros. We could develop a syntax for our DSL as long as it is recognised by the Clojure language (i.e. following some fundamental rules and syntax imposed by Clojure).Clojure has a heavy use of expressions in the language. Every expression is separated and seen as a separate object to Clojure. It could not phrase or recognise syntax like DT[, col1,col2] - Clojure cannot extract the keywords like col1 and col2 here. In other words, spacing is very important in Clojure, every expression is separated by a space. It is a fundamental syntax of Clojure. This is the biggest limitation imposed by Clojure.</description><author>Parry CHOI Chong Hing</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-Grace-ZHONG-Yanting/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-Grace-ZHONG-Yanting/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-Grace-ZHONG-Yanting/2022-02-24-Blog-Post-Grace-ZHONG-Yanting/</link><title>First Blog - Grace Zhong</title><description>After some back and forth, I decided on the pure computer science project – heap in Clojure, as an exploration in data structure while catering for a small technical need in Clojask.After some research and discussion, I found that there are two main methods to approach this problem:</description><author>Grace ZHONG Yanting</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-17-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/2022-02-17-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-17-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/2022-02-17-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/</link><title>Using MUI as a Framework</title><description>In my previous blog, I have mentioned that I have switched from figwheel to shadow-cljs, and that I have also chosen to use Reagent for my web app.For the past two weeks, I have further chosen to use reagent-material-ui as the framework for my Reagent components. reagent-material-ui is a wrapper for MUI, which is a very popular framework for React components.</description><author>Oscar Jay LEW</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-11-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-02-11-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-11-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-02-11-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</link><title>Blog Three - A More Mature Website</title><description>I failed to find a way to change the language of the date, so I changed my system language.

A small change can affect the layout of the entire page. I did it very carefully: I tested the website each time I made a minor change. I made some mistakes, but I could fix the problems without influencing the actual website because I tried the layout locally. In the end, it turned out that I didn’t mess up, and the website looks better and better now.</description><author>Kevin ZHANG Wenkai</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/2022-02-09-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/</link><title>Data Science in Finance - Third Blog</title><description>Work I have done these daysApply strategy to real data set.Apply the basic delta-heding strategy to 5 years data (from 2016 to 2020).

With the lower investment confidence, which is denoted by higher q, there are higher probabilities that some equity offers would be rejected (Vrankić &amp; Skoko, 2021). This might lead to a preliminary hypothesis that a higher share ratio in the offer might be correlated with a lower investment confidence and thus, a lower investment success ratio (Vismara, 2016).</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/2022-01-29-Blog-Post-Parry-CHOI-Chong-Hing/</link><title>Implementation of Query Foundation</title><description>The implementation of the DSL query foundation went well. The biggest problem I have encountered was the group by operation. This is mainly due to the difference in the output results of the generic query and the tech.ml.dataset. The group by function in tech.ml.dataset outputs a map with the column values (or indices) to the corresponding datatable; while our query would be outputting a single datatable, similar to SQL query. The library also does not support multiple column group-by operation.To solve the difference in output, a table join between the first item in group-by datatable and the descriptive table is made. This combines all the aggregated columns and the original columns, forming a table with all columns.</description><author>Parry CHOI Chong Hing</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-24-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-01-24-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-24-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/2022-01-24-Blog-Post-Kevin-ZHANG-Wenkai/</link><title>Blog Two - Being Part of the INTERNET</title><description>The website has been successfully deployed on the internet in the last two weeks. Its link is https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/ . I have uploaded six posts onto the website and updated the home, about, and content pages to make the website look more professional. I have developed a well-organized way to manage all the posts and pages: I now keep each markdown file and its images in one single folder under content/md instead of all images under content/img. In this way, images in different posts can have the same name, and posts can be moved easily without worrying about losing their images. I also tried to do a version control: I keep a copy of the former version of the website locally in case the newer version messes up.I also met some problems. Although math formulas can be shown correctly in the preview of the website, Cryogen cannot recognize them. In the end, I managed to solve it by adding a few lines of JavaScript codes, which converted plain MathJax lines to corresponding formulas. But some complex formulas still cannot be rendered. Another problem is that the website showed dates in Chinese. It seemed that the dates were automatically generated, and their language was based on the developer’s system language, which in my case is Chinese.</description><author>Kevin ZHANG Wenkai</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-20-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/2022-01-20-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-20-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/2022-01-20-Blog-Post-Oscar-Jay-LEW/</link><title>Using Reagent for my Web App</title><description>In the last blog, I mentioned that I was deciding between figwheel and shadow-cljs.After doing some research, I have chosen to use figwheel as my initial development tool for the web app, as it is written on the Clojure website that “figwheel-main has fewer moving parts than shadow-cljs and is therefore very simple to learn and work with”.</description><author>Oscar Jay LEW</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2022-01-17-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</link><title>Concessions and Test Run of Game Model</title><description>Some Concessions I made.When constructing my game model, I found that I was too ambitious when trying to incorporate time series factors and what I had done just made the whole model too intricate for me.

Although bitcoin also supports smart contracts, it was built with the intention of being an alternative to national currencies. Whereas for Ethereum, it was built for the purpose of facilitating programmatic contracts and applications, as according to Investopedia.

Suppose we have the project with the success rate $p_0$, and failure rate $p_i=1-p_0$. It is the firm deciding at which date $t \ge 0$ it will invest. The rationale of delaying investment is to do experiment and learn about the project, the longer they need to learn, the lower quality the firms have. According to Vrankić and Skoko (2021), this learning process could be following a Poisson process with $\lambda$ as the intensity of observing a low-quality project in firms' experiment if $\lambda \ge 0$. Hence, the higher the $\lambda$ is, the lower type the firm belongs to.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-12-19-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</link><title>Initial Ideas About the Signaling Game Model for Clojuring</title><description>Initial ideas about the signaling game model I wish my Clojure to simulate.Suppose for an investment opportunity with payoff $\pi$, there are two types of firms with different profitability $\lambda_h$ and $\lambda_l$.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-LIN-Maoran/</link><title>Some Initiatives About my Project</title><description>Some initiatives about my project: My project would like to investigate whether the firms’ timing in investment and operation could be effectively used as a signal to evaluate their qualities. Without clear pictures about firms’ real quality, investors and financial institutions would need signals to facilitate their financing decisions. It would be assumed by investors that firms with lower quality would choose to delay their investment and operation while high-performance companies would have earlier implementation of their decisions. Hence, as a strategy to fool outsiders, the low-quality firms would have the signal incentive to mimic the investment timeline as high-quality firms to extract bonus in their loans, while the high- type firm would try to distinct their identities by accelerating their investments and operations. We would like to explore how Clojure could help us build a signaling game model to evaluate the effectiveness of this timing strategy. We would then apply this model with empirical panel data collected by a World Banks’ Enterprise level survey on Chinese enterprises to test its validity.</description><author>LIN Maoran</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/</guid><link>https://clojure-finance.github.io/HKU-TDLEG-website/HKU-TDLEG-website/posts-output/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/2021-11-21-Blog-Post-Cindy-WANG-Xizhuo/</link><title>Data Science in Finance - First Blog</title><description>Work I have done these daysComposing the research proposalThis is the first time for me to write a research proposal. I have included all the contents that I regarded necessary for the audience to know what the
research is doing. However, there are still some parts that need more details.Conducting literature reviewI am reviewing a lot of research that other people have done about hedging strategies. The part that I am most interested in is how they selected data,
how they came up with the strategy, and also how they put their ideas in practice.Learning ClojureI have gone through the Clojure by examples. However, only simple syntax may be not
enough. Therefore, I will explore more sources the learn the language.</description><author>Cindy WANG Xizhuo</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
